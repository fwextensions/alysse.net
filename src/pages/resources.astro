						A lot of people ask what the County Superintendent does when their town already is part of a school district with a superintendent. Here’s the key: the Superintendent has a discretionary budget of $25 million and Alysse Castro will use it to help schools move towards higher quality education, equality, and justice. The wrong-headed path of school closure and privatization is a waste of money that doesn’t end with better outcomes for students. Instead, Alysse will partner with local organizations to build systems of care that support the physical and mental health of students and their families, and provide personalized learning for equality and agency for all kids. Alysse has the skills and the experience to do this work. She is a lifelong educator, specializing in kids who are furthest from opportunity, and an expert in school financing.

						Teachers, school staff, and administrators know how important the County Superintendent’s Office is. It’s the key to building a better, more equitable system, but Alameda County isn’t using it well right now – when it’s used at all. That’s why Alysse Castro is in this race: to use the office to help schools move towards higher quality education, equality, and justice. The superintendent has a discretionary budget of $25 million and Alysse will use these funds to end the death spiral of school closure and privatization – a waste of money that doesn’t end with better outcomes for students. Kids need more than “choices” when it comes to school – they need a guarantee of a school that serves them, bolstered by integrated systems of care that support the physical and mental health of students and their families. Alysse has the skills and the experience to do this work. She is a lifelong educator, specializing in kids who are furthest from opportunity, and an expert in school financing. Join the California Teachers’ Association, the Alameda County Teachers’ Association, the California School Employees Association, and many more in supporting Alysse Castro for Alameda Superintendent of Schools.
