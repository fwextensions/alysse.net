				Provide life-changing education to our most-vulnerable kids in county
				schools including schools for students in juvenile hall, in the
				delinquency and dependency system, and special services for foster and
				homeless youth. County Schools that change outcomes for these kids don't
				just change their lives, they forever improve our community safety,
				stability, and resources. Alysse currently operates schools that change
				lives and remove kids from the prison pipeline every day.

				It's hard to learn when you are worried about food, health, immigration,
				or tension at home. Remove barriers to learning by partnering closely
				with community agencies to provide wrap-around services on campus,
				sometimes called a Community Schools approach. Alameda has a rich
				ecosystem of governmental and community-based organizations dedicated to
				supporting our young people, but currently too many schools and
				districts are going it alone. Alysse has a long history of forging
				partnerships that embed millions of dollars in services on campuses.

				Burgeoning bureaucracy and chronic underfunding take resources from
				classrooms and lead to the death spiral of school closure and
				privatization. Currently, we have some communities that can guarantee
				that every school will provide every student an excellent education. But
				many Alameda County kids are left out. They live in communities where
				schools have been hollowed out by chronic underinvestment, and families
				are left to navigate the bewildering panoply of bussing, lotteries,
				charter schools that open and close &mdash; all dressed up as choices.
				Kids deserve guarantees, not choices.

				Address the teacher shortage by growing our own talent, committed to our
				own neighborhoods. California is facing a growing teacher shortage and
				most educators today report feeling exhausted and overwhelmed. By
				engaging educators as innovators and designers of strategies who meet
				the needs of their kids, Alysse has grown a powerful team serving the
				kids of our community. While many teachers are worn down by the
				conditions in urban schools and eventually seek positions in well-to-do
				neighborhoods, Alysse has 15 years of proof that if you create the
				conditions for teachers to thrive, teachers from our communities will
				fight to stay with the kids who need them most.

				Learning happens when kids are free from fear: from COVID, from
				bullying, from violence, from hunger, from police. The sad fact is that
				we are raising a generation of youth with trauma: the majority of our
				young people are living with epidemic scarcity, anxiety, and
				uncertainty. They need trauma-informed schools marked by peace,
				predictability, and positive behavior intervention and support. These
				teachable systems improve lives for students, staff, and families.
				Alysse has been developing these systems for 20 years with highest risk
				youth, leading to schools with a vanishingly small rate of threats,
				fights and suspensions &mdash; far fewer than at neighboring schools and
				far lower than these same students had at their last schools.

				Learning is deeply satisfying. If going to school isn't exciting, we are
				doing school wrong. The factory model of schooling has tried for a
				century to train public school students for the worst jobs of adulthood
				&mdash; punching a clock, filling out forms, doing repetitive tasks,
				sitting in rows. The most prestigious private schools do the opposite:
				personalizing learning, integrating subjects, flexing the calendar, and
				building students' agency, choice, and voice. Pandemic schooling has
				created the opportunity to build back better, with learning systems that
				meet kids where they are and let every student succeed.
