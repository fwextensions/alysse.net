			Alysse Castro is the Alameda County Superintendent of Schools, a lifelong
			educator who has built her career fighting for the students the system
			wasn't designed for. A former classroom teacher, principal, and county
			leader, Alysse has dedicated over two decades to transforming the
			conditions that hold vulnerable students back — and building the systems
			that allow them to thrive. She brings a rare blend of deep instructional
			expertise, technical mastery of Ed Code and school finance, and an
			unwavering commitment to equity.
		</p>
		<p class="text-lg">
			Since taking office as County Superintendent, Alysse has led with a simple
			belief: students who face the greatest barriers deserve the strongest,
			most innovative public systems. Her leadership has been defined by turning
			red tape into real solutions, modernizing outdated structures, and
			delivering measurable results for young people who are too often
			overlooked — youth in juvenile court schools, students experiencing
			homelessness, multilingual learners, and those navigating generational
			poverty.

			Under Alysse's leadership, the Alameda County Office of Education
			sponsored and passed its first-ever piece of legislation — and it passed
			unanimously. <strong>AB 2181</strong>, now awaiting signature, ensures
			students in juvenile court schools have a full pathway to a high school
			diploma, correcting decades-old gaps in the Education Code. The bill
			expands graduation opportunities, reduces unnecessary barriers, and
			provides new avenues for students whose educational journeys were
			interrupted by the juvenile justice system. The work behind AB 2181
			reflects exactly who Alysse is: an advocate who knows how to navigate the
			complexity of state law — and who uses that expertise to dismantle
			systemic inequities.

			Alysse's tenure has also brought a fundamental reframing of what it means

			around the students who have historically been last in line for resources
			— and the educators who serve them. Through a countywide vision and set of

			Alysse's work is shaped by her early years as an educator in schools
			serving students experiencing homelessness, foster youth, emerging
			bilinguals, and students navigating trauma and instability. These
			experiences built her belief that public education is the most powerful
			tool we have to disrupt the predetermination of failure for children
			growing up in communities impacted by violence and poverty — and that
			leaders must be bold enough to change systems that aren't working.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4">
			Alysse is a self-professed "school finance nerd" who can translate complex
			fiscal structures into real opportunities for kids, and a trusted
			statewide expert on Ed Code who uses regulatory expertise not as a
			barrier, but as a lever for equity. She is honored to be invited by
			elected officials and labor leaders alike to help build understanding and
			trust in complex school budgets.
		</p>
		<p class="text-lg font-semibold text-blue-900">
			Alysse continues to lead with clarity, courage, and heart — championing
			the students who have the least, demanding more of the systems that serve
			them, and delivering results that prove what is possible when we put the
			most vulnerable children at the center of every decision.
