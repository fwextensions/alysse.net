				Public education is a promise of quality of life for every kid and every

			Equip the most vulnerable students — and the educators who serve them —

			Every child deserves safety, stability, and opportunity. And every

			expertise, and a no-nonsense approach to cutting through bureaucracy to
			make that happen.
