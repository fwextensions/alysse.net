Learning is deeply satisfying. If going to school isn't exciting, we are doing school wrong. The factory model of schooling has tried for a century to train public school students for the worst jobs of adulthood — punching a clock, filling out forms, doing repetitive tasks, sitting in rows. The most prestigious private schools do the opposite: personalizing learning, integrating subjects, flexing the calendar, and building students' agency, choice, and voice. Pandemic schooling has created the opportunity to build back better, with learning systems that meet kids where they are and let every student succeed.
