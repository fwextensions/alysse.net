Address the teacher shortage by growing our own talent, committed to our own neighborhoods. California is facing a growing teacher shortage and most educators today report feeling exhausted and overwhelmed. By engaging educators as innovators and designers of strategies who meet the needs of their kids, Alysse has grown a powerful team serving the kids of our community. While many teachers are worn down by the conditions in urban schools and eventually seek positions in well-to-do neighborhoods, Alysse has 15 years of proof that if you create the conditions for teachers to thrive, teachers from our communities will fight to stay with the kids who need them most.
