Provide life-changing education to our most-vulnerable kids in county schools including schools for students in juvenile hall, in the delinquency and dependency system, and special services for foster and homeless youth. County Schools that change outcomes for these kids don't just change their lives, they forever improve our community safety, stability, and resources. Alysse currently operates schools that change lives and remove kids from the prison pipeline every day.
