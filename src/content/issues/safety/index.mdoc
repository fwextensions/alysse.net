Learning happens when kids are free from fear: from COVID, from bullying, from violence, from hunger, from police. The sad fact is that we are raising a generation of youth with trauma: the majority of our young people are living with epidemic scarcity, anxiety, and uncertainty. They need trauma-informed schools marked by peace, predictability, and positive behavior intervention and support. These teachable systems improve lives for students, staff, and families. Alysse has been developing these systems for 20 years with highest risk youth, leading to schools with a vanishingly small rate of threats, fights and suspensions — far fewer than at neighboring schools and far lower than these same students had at their last schools.
