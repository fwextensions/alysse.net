Our teachers and principals work incredibly hard to make good on that promise. Yet they work inside of a system of laws, rules, and red tape that get in the way of keeping that promise to every kid and every family.</p></div>\n\n**As your County Superintendent, I lead with one defining priority:**\n\n**Equip the most vulnerable students — and the educators who serve them — with the tools to thrive.**\n\nEvery child deserves safety, stability, and opportunity. And every educator deserves the support of a system that works. I bring the unique combination of equity-driven values, deep ed-code and school-finance expertise, and a no-nonsense approach to cutting through bureaucracy to make that happen.\n"
