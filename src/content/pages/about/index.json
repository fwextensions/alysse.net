A former classroom teacher, principal, and county leader, Alysse has dedicated over two decades to transforming the conditions that hold vulnerable students back — and building the systems that allow them to thrive. She brings a rare blend of deep instructional expertise, technical mastery of Ed Code and school finance, and an unwavering commitment to equity.\n\nSince taking office as County Superintendent, Alysse has led with a simple belief: students who face the greatest barriers deserve the strongest, most innovative public systems. Her leadership has been defined by turning red tape into real solutions, modernizing outdated structures, and delivering measurable results for young people who are too often overlooked — youth in juvenile court schools, students experiencing homelessness, multilingual learners, and those navigating generational poverty.\n"

The bill expands graduation opportunities, reduces unnecessary barriers, and provides new avenues for students whose educational journeys were interrupted by the juvenile justice system. The work behind AB 2181 reflects exactly who Alysse is: an advocate who knows how to navigate the complexity of state law — and who uses that expertise to dismantle systemic inequities.\n\n<div class=\"mt-6 p-6 bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-600\"> <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-blue-900 mb-3\">🏆 California Golden Bell Award</h3>\n\nAlysse also led Alameda County to win a California Golden Bell Award for its groundbreaking workforce diversification effort, the **Professional Advancement and Training Hub (PATH)**.\n\nLaunched just two years ago, PATH has already:\n\n- ✓ Helped **1,500 residents** plan careers in education\n- ✓ Funded credentials for **130 multilingual intern teachers**\n- ✓ Supported **100 new instructional aides**\n- ✓ Graduated **54 residents** from a local teacher residency\n- ✓ Helped **200 educators** earn clear credentials\n\nThe program is now considered a statewide model for how government can build an educator workforce that reflects and serves diverse communities — and solve staffing shortages with local talent.\n</div>\n"

These experiences built her belief that public education is the most powerful tool we have to disrupt the predetermination of failure for children growing up in communities impacted by violence and poverty — and that leaders must be bold enough to change systems that aren't working.\n\nAlysse is a self-professed \"school finance nerd\" who can translate complex fiscal structures into real opportunities for kids, and a trusted statewide expert on Ed Code who uses regulatory expertise not as a barrier, but as a lever for equity. She is honored to be invited by elected officials and labor leaders alike to help build understanding and trust in complex school budgets.\n\n**Alysse continues to lead with clarity, courage, and heart — championing the students who have the least, demanding more of the systems that serve them, and delivering results that prove what is possible when we put the most vulnerable children at the center of every decision.**\n"
