Quality & Equality - It won't happen by chance. It happens by change.

Break the School to Prison Pipeline

Provide life-changing education to our most-vulnerable kids in county schools including schools for students in juvenile hall, in the delinquency and dependency system, and special services for foster and homeless youth. County Schools that change outcomes for these kids don’t just change their lives, they forever improve our community safety, stability, and resources. Alysse currently operates schools that change lives and remove kids from the prison pipeline every day.

Embed systems of care in schools

It's hard to learn when you are worried about food, health, immigration, or tension at home. Remove barriers to learning by partnering closely with community agencies to provide wrap-around services on campus, sometimes called a Community Schools approach. Alameda has a rich ecosystem of governmental and community-based organizations dedicated to supporting our young people, but currently too many schools and districts are going it alone. Alysse has a long history of forging partnerships that embed millions of dollars in services on campuses.

Our kids deserve guarantees, not choices

Burgeoning bureaucracy and chronic underfunding take resources from classrooms and lead to the death spiral of school closure and privatization. Currently, we have some communities that can guarantee that every school will provide every student an excellent education. But many Alameda County kids are left out. They live in communities where schools have been hollowed out by chronic underinvestment, and families are left to navigate the bewildering panoply of bussing, lotteries, charter schools that open and close - all dressed up as choices. Kids deserve guarantees, not choices.

Teachers from our community for our community

Address the teacher shortage by growing our own talent, committed to our own neighborhoods. California is facing a growing teacher shortage and most educators today report feeling exhausted and overwhelmed. By engaging educators as innovators and designers of strategies who meet the needs of their kids, Alysse has grown a powerful team serving the kids of our community. While many teachers are worn down by the conditions in urban schools and eventually seek positions in well-to-do neighborhoods, Alysse has 15 years of proof that if you create the conditions for teachers to thrive, teachers from our communities will fight to stay with the kids who need them most.

Safety comes from support

Learning happens when kids are free from fear: from COVID, from bullying, from violence, from hunger, from police. The sad fact is that we are raising a generation of youth with trauma: the majority of our young people are living with epidemic scarcity, anxiety, and uncertainty. They need trauma-informed schools marked by peace, predictability, and positive behavior intervention and support. These teachable systems improve lives for students, staff, and families. Alysse has been developing these systems for 20 years with highest risk youth, leading to schools with a vanishingly small rate of threats, fights and suspensions - far fewer than at neighboring schools and far lower than these same students had at their last schools.

Personalize learning for equity & agency

Learning is deeply satisfying. If going to school isn’t exciting, we are doing school wrong. The factory model of schooling has tried for a century to train public school students for the worst jobs of adulthood - punching a clock, filling out forms, doing repetitive tasks, sitting in rows. The most prestigious private schools do the opposite: personalizing learning, integrating subjects, flexing the calendar, and building students' agency, choice, and voice. Pandemic schooling has created the opportunity to build back better, with learning systems that meet kids where they are and let every student succeed;
